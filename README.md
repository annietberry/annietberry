# Hi there!

My name is Annie Tombari and I am currently studying at Boise CodeWorks to become a fullstack software developer. I found coding by chance when I had to take a few coding classes during college. Coding quickly became a passion. I enjoy understanding how things work so I have been gravitating towards back-end development. 

💻 Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & MVC
